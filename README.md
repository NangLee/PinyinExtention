As much as i suck at js this guy did better
https://github.com/peterolson/hanzi-tools/

half way through the project i found this guys thing that i wanted to make and it was way better but then i realised it wasnt an extention
i tried to convert it and it failed.

checkout hanzitools instead its peak
